Exercise 2

1. ColorImage.cpp is a program that takes a look at colorspace conversions in
OpenCV. Run the code in ColorImage.cpp and comment on the outputs.
Implement the same thing in Python and save each image.

The 3 outputs of each models of colorspaces are very different from those of other models.

2. Print out the values of the pixel at (20,25) in the RGB, YCbCr and HSV
versions of the image. What are the ranges of pixel values in each channel
of each of the above mentioned colorspaces?

('RGB part', array([106, 122, 225], dtype=uint8))
('YCC part:', array([151, 181, 103], dtype=uint8))
('HSV part', array([  4, 135, 225], dtype=uint8))
