Exercise 4

1. Look at Threshold.cpp and implement the code in Python, and observe
the results for different threshold values. Comment on the results.

Thresholding Image is like a black and white version of the input image.
Semi Thresholding is a inverse color version of Thresholding Image.
Binary tresholding has more distinct black and white than thresholding Image.
Band Thresholding is a inverse color version of Binary tresholding.
Adaptive Thresholding perfectly draw the outline of the input image.

2. What are the disadvantages of binary threshold?



3. When is Adaptive Threshold useful?
