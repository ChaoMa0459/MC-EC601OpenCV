Exercise 1

1. How does a program read the cvMat object, in particular, what is the
order of the pixel structure?

The object is read by cv2.imread as follows:
src = cv2.imread(sys.argv[1], 1)
input_planes = []
input_planes = cv2.split(src)

the order of the pixel structure is [Blue_pixel, Green_pixel, Red_pixel]
